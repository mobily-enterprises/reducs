# Reducs: a sane implementation of Redux

Reducs is a sane implementation of Redux. Key differences:

* It's less than 30 lines of clean ES6 code
* You don't need to read pages and pages of documentation to learn it
* Actions are functions that do something. There is no dispatching nor reducers
* Your application won't waste time listening for state changes it doesn't care about
* Actions are easy to code
* Multiple branches of a status are managed separately

See it in action:

* [In a lit-element project](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/lacy-ornament)
* ...more to come eventually
